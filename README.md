# Color-Quest

Hello, this is a simple platformer that me and three group members designed for a school project.

Installation:
  1. Install Greenfoot https://www.greenfoot.org/download/installation
  2. Unzip the file and open with the Greenfoot IDE
  3. It may take a while but once the screen is prompted, press 'run' to start playing!

Thanks again to my group members and for DanPost for his help in the scrolling world class.
